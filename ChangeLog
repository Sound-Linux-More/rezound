2002-09-05 12:19  ddurham

	* src/backend/CrezSoundTranslator.cpp: Hade to include
	TPoolFile.cpp in CrezSoundTranslator because I am using some

	defined in this source file.  Changed the PCM type to be a little
	more descriptive

2002-09-05 12:18  ddurham

	* src/backend/CSound.cpp: Chose CSound.cpp for where to explicitly
	instantiate TPoolFile for CSound's purposes

2002-09-05 12:17  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/: TPoolFile.cpp, TPoolFile.h: Changed TPoolFile.h
	not include TPoolFile.cpp because I've started using explicit

2002-09-04 20:37  ddurham

	* configure.in: Enhanced the detection of fftw so that it would
	print a warning that all fft based actions would be disabled if the
	library wasn't found.  Slightly modified some of the other error
	messages in configure.in

2002-09-04 14:31  ddurham

2002-09-04 13:42  ddurham

	* configure.in: made configure just remove config.cache at the

	re-running configure after installing some library

2002-09-04 12:33  ddurham

	* src/backend/Effects/CTestEffect.cpp: Changed CTestEffect to use
	FFT convolution instead of simple convolution

2002-09-04 12:32  ddurham

	* src/backend/DSP/Convolver.h: Added TFFTConvolver which uses
	lib[r]fftw and can quickly do convolution with large filter
	kernels.  There will probably be some more work on this class as I
	implement other FFT systems/actions

	This way I can optimize or specialize templates without it getting
	as messy Also, I save some compile sanity since I'm not always
	compiling every DSP block whenever I just need one.  I also moved

	libportaudio Made the native sample rate and number of channels a
	global variable and a registry setting There is still a little more
	work to do to support libportaudio better.  I need to know when
	libportaudio wasn't able to open a device to the exact sample rate
	that was asked for.  Until this is a knowable thing in libportaudio
	I just have to assume it worked.  Also a little issue of knowing if
	a device supports full duplex needs to be resolved, but I think I
	have an idea how to do it For now, until libportaudio fixed the
	sample rate problem I have left OSS as the default method of audio
	I/O

	significant changes to the frontend drawing which used to be all
	within FXRezWaveView  - Now I broken it into FXRezWaveView,
	FXWaveScrollArea and FXWaveCanvas - This should be a little more
	efficient with X, because it does very little forcing of drawing
	right away - This change should also make the code a bit more
	resuable, I should be able to use FXWaveCanvas in FXGraphParamValue
	as a given background, so other backgrounds can be used with
	FXGraphParamValue - Made the horz zoom dial have more positions -
	Removed a little bit of unecessary code - Fixed some bugs wth the
	scrolling of the sound window when part of the window is off screen
	- updated the TODO concerning this

	LFO name, and uses it in the dropdown list of LFO shapes

2002-08-23 01:04  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am: Made the frontend Makefile recur on
	make after generating the CFOXIcons.* source files since it had
	already checked the timestamps on those files before it
	re-generated them

2002-08-23 01:03  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/convert_images.sh: Made the convert_images.sh

	CActionParameterDialog to support creating FXLFOParamValue widgets
	Made the flange frontend dialog use this LFO widget for selecting

	Implemented a few more LFOs, but will implement more soon.  Created
	CLFORegsitry which is a factory used to create LFO objects of

	src/frontend_fox/RemasterActionDialogs.cpp,
	src/frontend_fox/RemasterActionDialogs.h: Added a normalize
	function under the Remaster actions When region count is more than
	1 it breaks the selection into regions and draws lines between the
	maxes it finds for each region to adjust the volume.  This is a
	little unorthodox as far as I know.. It may not be even
	normalization, but someone should tell me that one day and I'll
	rename it

2002-08-15 15:15  ddurham

	frontend_fox/FilterActionDialogs.cpp: Changed CActionParameters to
	be accessed by name instead of by position.  This does a few
	things:    - adds a somewhat higher level of action parameter
	checking of getting parameters since a name has to exist instead of
	just a position  - also, the frontend's widgets don't have to be in
	any particular order where as before they did have to be I left the
	old methods-by-position in CActionParameters because they do all
	the work, but I made them private.

	* src/frontend_fox/CAboutDialog.cpp: Added 2 thankses in the
	CAboutDialog

2002-08-06 19:46  ddurham

	* src/backend/CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp: Fixed an annoyance with
	seeking and the new prebuffering scheme, so now it sets the
	prebufferPosition to the playPosition whenever clearning the
	prebuffered data in setSeekSpeed()

2002-08-06 15:22  ddurham

	* configure.in, docs/Features.txt, docs/INSTALL, docs/NEWS,
	docs/devel/TODO_release: Made changes concerning the 0.3.0alpha
	release

2002-08-06 13:09  ddurham

	* src/backend/TODO: added a backend TODO about automatically
	defragging in the furture

2002-08-06 13:04  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/TPoolFile.cpp: Fixed a bug I introduced in the last
	change where TPoolFile::printSAT() wouldn't print the whole SAT

2002-08-06 12:02  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CMainWindow.cpp, EditActionDialogs.cpp,
	EditActionDialogs.h: Added frontend controls for the new "Add
	Channels" and "Remove Channels" edit actions

2002-08-06 12:01  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/TODO: update to TODO

2002-08-06 11:56  ddurham

	* src/backend/: AAction.cpp, AAction.h, CSound.cpp, CSound.h,
	CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp, CSoundPlayerChannel.h, TODO,
	Edits/CAddChannelsEdit.cpp, Edits/CAddChannelsEdit.h,
	Edits/CRemoveChannelsEdit.cpp, Edits/CRemoveChannelsEdit.h,
	Edits/EditActions.h, Edits/Makefile.am: Added CSound::addChannels,
	CSound::addChannel, CSound::removeChannels, CSound::removeChannel,
	CSound::moveChannelsToTemp and CSound::moveChannelsFromTemp which
	are all used to add and remove channels from a sound.  Changed
	AAction to backup the output routing information before doing an
	action so that actions that change the number of channels and then
	are undone will restore the original output routing information. (I
	suppose this should have been left up to CAddChannelsEdit and
	CRemoveChannelsEdit, but perhaps other actions will later
	add/remove channels too) Care had be to taken in AAction to make
	sure the output routing information in CSoundPlayerChannel gets
	recreated if it's now invalid because the number of channels has
	changed.  Added CSound::removeGeneralDataPool() which is not
	actually used by anything yet.	Added CAddChannelsEdit and
	CRemoveChannelsEdit to make use of the new methods in CSound. 
	Updated the TODOs concerning these changes

2002-08-06 11:46  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/: TODO, TPoolFile.cpp, TPoolFile.h: Mainly made
	TPoolFile not invalidate existing poolIds after removing a pool. 
	poolIds are really an index into the pools and SAT vectors, so
	removing a pool moved the elements around in these vectors.  Now,
	however, I don't actually remove the spots in these vectors, I just
	mark them as not valid pools.  And then I reuse these spots the
	next time a pool is to be created.  I also had to make provisions
	so that when a the SAT information is restored from a copy on disk
	incase of a crash or restore while still running that these invalid
	spots are also maintained.  Also cleaned up some comments and made
	some minor changes concerning some of the notes at the top of
	TPoolFile

2002-08-06 11:42  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CChannelSelectDialog.cpp,
	CChannelSelectDialog.h: Added a "Clear" and "Default" button to
	CChannelSelectDialog

2002-08-06 11:41  ddurham

	* src/backend/Edits/CCopyCutDeleteEdit.cpp: Added a check at the
	top of CCopyCutDeleteEdit::doAction just to make sure that at least
	one channel is going to be copied, cut, or deleted. However, I was
	already checking that in the frontend

2002-08-06 11:40  ddurham

	* src/backend/CNativeSoundClipboard.cpp: Fixed a bug where I was
	not initializing CNativeSoundClipboard::length to 0 where it would
	sometimes return that it was not empty when infact nothing had ever
	been copied to it

2002-08-06 11:09  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CChannelSelectDialog.cpp,
	CPasteChannelsDialog.cpp: Changed the labels to 0-based lables
	instead of 1-based because everything else has been 0-based so far

2002-08-06 00:56  ddurham

	* src/backend/CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp: Fixed a little, but fatal
	bug in CSoundPlayerChannel with the new prebuffering code where it
	needed to make sure that prebuffer was still within a valid range
	after obtaining the sizeLock on the sound

2002-08-05 17:13  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/TODO: Added some TODOs for PoolFile

2002-08-04 23:23  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CSoundWindow.cpp: Changed
	CSoundWindow::recreateMuteButtons() to restore the checked state of
	the new check buttons as the old check buttons

2002-08-04 23:19  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CSoundWindow.cpp, CSoundWindow.h: Made
	CSoundWindow::updateFromEdit() recreate the mute buttons and zoom
	out vertically if the number of channels changes after an action

2002-08-04 02:44  ddurham

	* src/backend/CActionParameters.cpp: Made unsigned and double types
	interchangeable when getting the value

	* src/frontend_fox/: CActionParamDialog.cpp, CActionParamDialog.h,
	FXCheckBoxParamValue.cpp, FXCheckBoxParamValue.h, Makefile.am:
	Added FXCheckBoxParamValue which can creates a check box on the
	standard action dialog and can save and load itself for presets

2002-08-03 00:41  ddurham

	* src/backend/COSSSoundRecorder.cpp: Changed COSSSoundRecorder to
	4k from a recommendation from someone at www.opensound.com

2002-08-02 14:33  ddurham

	* src/misc/TMemoryPipe.cpp: Fixed a bug in TMemoryPipe::getSize()
	where it was always reporting one element too small

2002-08-02 11:54  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: COggDialog.cpp, COggDialog.h: Since Ogg/Vorbis
	seems to have trouble supporting constant bitrates sometimes (it
	says unimplemented feature a lot) I change the quality setting to
	be the default on the frontend

2002-08-02 01:53  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClibvorbisSoundTranslator.cpp: Enhanced
	ClibvorbisSoundTranslator a little bit to give some more
	information on errors

2002-08-02 01:12  ddurham

	* src/: backend/ASoundFileManager.h, backend/main_controls.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CSoundFileManager.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CSoundFileManager.h: Made ReZound ask to quit if the
	users presses 'exit' and there is more than 1 file opened... I know
	that might seem annoying but I've accidently closed ReZound
	accidently after I had spent a while just opening the sounds I
	wanted

2002-08-02 01:02  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CFrontendHooks.cpp: Fixed a slight bug with the
	save-as dialog being pointed to the last opened directory

2002-08-02 01:02  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Added a TODO

2002-08-01 23:33  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: added a TODO

2002-08-01 16:45  ddurham

	* src/backend/TODO: updated the backend TODO

2002-08-01 16:44  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp, CSoundPlayerChannel.h,
	CrezSoundTranslator.cpp: Reworked the output routing system to be
	more flexible to allow a channel in the audio to be able to map to
	more than one device channel Made some comments in the
	CrezSoundTranslator saying to implement saving/loading of this
	information later I may want to do that in
	ClibaudiofileSoundTranslator when I'm more sure about the routing
	info I still need to develop a frontend to manipulate the routing
	info

2002-08-01 02:29  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CFrontendHooks.cpp: Fixed a little bug on the
	frontend where if you opened a sound, then closed it, then opened
	the open dialog again, the filename would be blank, so hitting okay
	would try to load ""

2002-08-01 02:15  ddurham

	* src/backend/: ASoundFileManager.cpp, ASoundPlayer.cpp,
	ASoundPlayer.h, COSSSoundPlayer.cpp, CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp,
	CSoundPlayerChannel.h: Changed CSoundPlayerChannel to use a
	TMemoryPipe for handling prebuffering of data itself rather than
	just pushing as much data as possible to the sound card driver. 
	This makes the play position more accuratly knowable in the
	presence of prebuffering data.	Removed the concept of evelopes
	from CSoundPlayerChannel (it wasn't used and over complicated the
	code) Remove the gain and pan settings of CSoundPlayerChannel (they
	were not being used) Removed the idea of stop() and kill() in
	CSoundPlayerChannel since the envelope is gone.  stop() stops the
	playing immediately

2002-08-01 02:12  ddurham

	* src/backend/TSoundStretcher.h: Made many enhancements to
	TSoundStretcher.h including a method to get the current source
	position.  And supporting fractional buffer sizes (actually the src
	should probably contain at least the ceil() of the srcLength)

2002-08-01 02:10  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CEnvelope.cpp, CEnvelope.h, Makefile.am: Removed
	the idea of CEnvelope from CSoundPlayerChannel.  It wasn't being
	used and it complicated the code a lot.

2002-08-01 02:09  ddurham

	* docs/code/AudioIO: Updated the AudioIO document about more or
	less how the new prebuffering stuff works

2002-08-01 02:08  ddurham

	* src/misc/Makefile.am: Updated Makefile.am to reference
	TMemoryPipe and CConditionVariable

2002-08-01 02:08  ddurham

	* src/misc/: TMemoryPipe.cpp, TMemoryPipe.h: Added TMemoryPipe to
	the repository.  This template class is a pipe that uses RAM for
	storage and can do blocked I/O.  Among other things it is necessary
	over posix pipe() mainly because you can set the pipe size and the
	elements in the pipe have a defined type

2002-08-01 02:06  ddurham

	* src/misc/CConditionVariable.h: Added CConditionVariable.h which
	contains a wrapper class for the pthread_cond_t type

2002-08-01 02:05  ddurham

	* src/misc/CMutex.h: Changed CMutex::isLocked to actually return
	the zero or non-zero lockCount

2002-08-01 02:04  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CMainWindow.cpp, CMainWindow.h,
	CSoundWindow.cpp, FXRezWaveView.cpp: Changed the notion for
	CSoundPlayerChannel of playSpeed to seekSpeed in the backend, these
	are the changes necessary in the frontend

2002-08-01 02:02  ddurham

	* src/backend/TODO: updated the TODO

2002-07-31 13:54  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: added a TODO

2002-07-30 18:25  ddurham

	* src/misc/CMutex.h: Tweaked CMutex slightly where it won't make
	the locked count go negative

2002-07-29 00:21  ddurham

	* src/backend/: COSSSoundPlayer.cpp, COSSSoundRecorder.cpp,
	initialize.cpp, settings.cpp, settings.h: Added registry settings
	for the path to the OSS devices to use for output and input. 
	There's still no GUI for selecting the path, but atleast the users
	could edit the registry.dat file

2002-07-28 21:25  ddurham

	* src/backend/COSSSoundRecorder.cpp: Fixed a problem with the SB
	driver returning 0xMMMMSSSS from ioctl setting the buffering
	information where SSSS (the important part to check) was correct,
	but the less relavent part, MMMM, was slightly different for some
	reason than the given value

2002-07-27 23:40  ddurham

	* src/backend/COSSSoundRecorder.cpp: Changed the 8192 bytes of
	prebuffering for OSS recording to 4096 because the SB16 driver
	didn't didn't like buffers that big

2002-07-27 18:47  ddurham

	* make_standalone.sh: minor

2002-07-26 11:10  ddurham

	* configure.in, docs/INSTALL: bumped the version to 0.2.1alpha for
	an unofficial release to fix something for someone

2002-07-26 01:20  ddurham

	* src/backend/: ASoundFileManager.cpp, ASoundPlayer.cpp,
	ASoundPlayer.h, COSSSoundPlayer.cpp, COSSSoundPlayer.h: Made
	ReZound detect if the output device supports full duplex mode.	If
	not then ReZound deinitializes the audio output and reinitializes
	it after recording is finished

2002-07-26 01:13  ddurham

	* src/backend/CSound.cpp: fixed a bug in CSound::findWorkDir which
	didn't allow recording or creating new sounds because
	CPath::getSize() was being called on a non-existing file

2002-07-26 00:31  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/TODO: added a TODO

2002-07-26 00:22  ddurham

2002-07-23 19:22  ddurham

	* src/: backend/ClameSoundTranslator.cpp,
	misc/CNestedDataFile/CNestedDataFile.cpp: Fixed some more issues
	when loading mp3s by shelling to lame if the filename has a " in
	it.. or has a \ in it Made CNestedDataFile also escape \ and " if
	writing a string key's value to the file

2002-07-23 16:28  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClameSoundTranslator.cpp: Fixed a bug where lame was
	popened without quotes around the filename, so that filenames with
	spaces wouldn't load or save

2002-07-19 12:31  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Updated the overall TODO

2002-07-19 12:21  ddurham

	* src/misc/CMutex.h: Added CMutexLocker

2002-07-19 12:13  ddurham

	* src/backend/: TODO, initialize.cpp, settings.cpp, settings.h:
	Added registry settings for the clipboard directory and the
	clipboards' filenames prefix

	* src/misc/CPath.h: minor

2002-07-19 11:21  ddurham

	* src/backend/CSound.cpp: accidently forgot to remove the test file
	when seeing if it's possible to write to a file system

2002-07-18 23:03  ddurham

	* src/backend/settings.cpp: booboo

2002-07-18 17:31  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CSound.cpp, CSound.h, TODO, initialize.cpp,
	settings.cpp, settings.h: Made ReZound more intelligent by picking
	where to put the working file when loading a file.  First it tries
	to put it where the file was loaded from, then tries
	gFallbackWorkDir.  Eventually, gFallbackWorkDir should be a vector
	of several places to look.

2002-07-18 17:26  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/: TPoolFile.cpp, TPoolFile.h: Added
	TPoolFile::removeFile(const string filename) which attempts removes
	the file and the two SAT files, but later should make it remove
	multiple files in a CMultiFile

2002-07-17 16:03  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CMainWindow.cpp, CMainWindow.h,
	CSoundWindow.cpp, CSoundWindow.h: Enhanced the shuttle control with
	a toggle that sets how much affect the shuttle control has Had to
	add 2 data members to CSoundWindow to store the shuttle control's
	state information when switching between active CSoundWindow
	objects

2002-07-17 12:38  ddurham

	* docs/FrontendFoxFeatures.txt, src/frontend_fox/CMainWindow.cpp,
	src/frontend_fox/CMainWindow.h: Added a toggle button next to the
	shuttle control which puts the shuttle control in 'spring-back
	mode' or 'free mode' Made the right mouse button clicked on the
	shutt control always recenter it Removed a couple of out-dated
	TODOs at the top of CMainWindow.cpp updated the FrontedFeatures.txt
	about the new shuttle control option

2002-07-17 10:58  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CMainWindow.cpp, CMainWindow.h,
	CSoundWindow.cpp: Made it so that when the active window changes,
	the shuttle control is modified according to the new active
	window's set playing speed incase it's not always 1.0 Next I'm
	going to enhance the shuttle control's features

2002-07-06 18:08  ddurham

	* src/backend/ASoundPlayer.cpp: modified comments

2002-07-05 12:09  ddurham

	* configure.in, config/acconfig.h,
	src/backend/ClameSoundTranslator.cpp, src/backend/Makefile.am,
	src/backend/mypopen.cpp, src/backend/mypopen.h: Worked around the
	apparent bug in glibc about threads and popen by writing my own
	popen which seems to work fine.

2002-07-04 17:12  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/TPoolFile.cpp: Fixed a bug in
	TPoolFile::joinAdjacentBlocks which possibly caused a segfault
	because of an index being out of bounds on a vector

2002-07-03 15:57  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClameSoundTranslator.cpp: Updated an error message in
	ClameSoundTranslator.cpp

	* src/frontend_fox/: CFrontendHooks.cpp, CFrontendHooks.h,
	CNewSoundDialog.cpp, CNewSoundDialog.h, CRecordDialog.cpp,
	CRecordDialog.h, main.cpp: Removed globals, gRecordDialog and
	gNewSoundDialog by making them data members in CFrontendHooks

2002-07-01 19:14  ddurham

	* src/backend/: ASoundFileManager.cpp, ASoundTranslator.cpp,

	Cold_rezSoundTranslator.h, CrawSoundTranslator.cpp,
	CrawSoundTranslator.h, CrezSoundTranslator.cpp,
	CrezSoundTranslator.h: Changed the return type of
	ASoundTranslator::onSaveSound (and ASoundTranslator::saveSound) so
	it could return false if the save was bailed on user intervetion
	(via a questionable save or later maybe a cancel) Made
	ClameSoundTranslator ask the user to proceed if cues or user notes
	are present

2002-07-01 18:36  ddurham

	* src/backend/: ClameSoundTranslator.cpp, ClameSoundTranslator.h,
	Makefile.am, initialize.cpp: Added mp3 support if lame is installed
	on the system and can be found in $PATH I tried to use lame's
	library API, but it's not docmented, so opening a pipe to the
	process was easier.  Still yet to do is perhaps use ID3 tag support
	to save cues and user notes.  If I can get lame to output the ID3
	tags on decode and somehow be able to add ID3 tags on encode, then
	it should be possible I still need to have it prompt the user on
	encode to ask for compression parameters.

2002-07-01 18:32  ddurham

	Cold_rezSoundTranslator.cpp, CrezSoundTranslator.cpp: Moved the
	setting of sound->setIsModified(false) from the derived
	SoundTranslator classes to the base class Moved .wav before .aiff
	in ClibaudiofileSoundTranslator

	made in cvs yet... but I'm hoping they will soon

2002-06-29 22:28  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClibvorbisSoundTranslator.h:
	libvorbisSoundTranslator.h was including audiofile.h unnecessarily

2002-06-29 15:17  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClibvorbisSoundTranslator.cpp: Added a complete
	support of saving and loading user notes and cues to
	ClibvorbisSoundTranslator There may be some unfortunate
	side-effects to multiline tagged user note entries, but that should
	only show up in other ogg players, but I don't think it's that
	serious

2002-06-29 13:40  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/FXRezWaveView.cpp: Added a comment about a
	drawing bug that I'm not going to worry about right now

2002-06-29 13:00  ddurham

	* src/backend/TODO: Added a TODO

2002-06-28 23:08  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClibvorbisSoundTranslator.cpp: Fixed a bug in
	ClibvorbisSoundTranslator that was corrupting the heap

2002-06-28 16:28  ddurham

	* src/backend/ClibaudiofileSoundTranslator.cpp: Tweaked
	ClibaudiofileSoundTranslator's progress bar support

2002-06-28 16:27  ddurham

	* src/backend/AStatusComm.h: Improved the usability of
	UPDATE_PROGRESS_BAR -- now it can handle skipping values where the
	mod expr would be zero

2002-06-28 16:26  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CSound.h, CSound.cpp: Added CSound::verifySAT()

	src/backend/ClibvorbisSoundTranslator.h, src/backend/Makefile.am,
	src/backend/initialize.cpp: Added preliminary ogg vorbis support. 
	Only loading is supported now.	Added tests for libvorbis,
	libvorbisfile and libogg in configure

2002-06-27 17:58  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CrawSoundTranslator.cpp, CrawSoundTranslator.h:
	Same as previous change for Clibaudiofile

	* docs/Features.txt: Added a document listing some of the features

2002-06-27 12:27  ddurham

	PasteChannels dialog

2002-06-27 12:16  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/FXModalDialogBox.cpp: Added a call to recalc()
	on show because I was having some display problems on the dialogs
	on show

2002-06-27 00:17  ddurham

	* docs/devel/: AutoMake-guide, TODO_release: Updated a couple of
	the docs about ReZound becoming rezound

2002-06-26 23:59  ddurham

	* src/: backend/Filters/CSinglePoleFilter.cpp,
	backend/Filters/CSinglePoleFilter.h,

2002-06-26 17:11  ddurham

	* src/: backend/initialize.cpp, backend/settings.cpp,
	backend/settings.h, frontend_fox/CActionParamDialog.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CActionParamDialog.h,
	frontend_fox/FXComboTextParamValue.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXComboTextParamValue.h,
	frontend_fox/FXConstantParamValue.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXConstantParamValue.h,
	frontend_fox/FXGraphParamValue.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXGraphParamValue.h,
	frontend_fox/FXTextParamValue.cpp, frontend_fox/FXTextParamValue.h:
	Improved the way that presets are loaded and saved.  Now instead of
	creating many many CNestedDataFile objects and reparsing the data
	many times.. Now it is done once at the start of the application.

2002-06-26 14:44  ddurham

	* config/am_include.mk: Removed PoolFile/DiskTable from the default
	include path

2002-06-26 13:40  ddurham

	* configure.in: Added a --enable-standalone flag to configure which
	adds -all-static and -ldl to the linker flags to libtool

2002-06-26 12:19  ddurham

	* src/: backend/AFrontendHooks.h, backend/initialize.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CFrontendHooks.cpp, frontend_fox/CFrontendHooks.h,
	frontend_fox/main.cpp: Changed the way that the share data
	directory is determinted.  When it does determine it, it checks to
	see if presets.dat can be found in that directory, and if not, then
	it asks the user to manually find it.  Had to add another frontend
	hook for prompting for a directory.

2002-06-25 22:14  ddurham

	* configure.in: Added the softlink creation in configure.in which
	just creates a link to the binary in the frontend dir if they're
	expecting an executable in the toplevel dir when compiled

2002-06-25 22:09  ddurham

	* src/backend/initialize.cpp: Fixed one more "ReZound" to "rezound"
	problem

2002-06-25 20:51  lergnom

	* configure.in, config/common.h, src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am:
	Changed ReZound binary and Package name to lowercase rezound.

2002-06-25 17:28  ddurham

	* configure.in: Added another way to check for fox, except this
	wouldn't print the nice big error message on fail, however I could
	just pass a macro call which prints all that on the if-failed
	parameter to the AC_CHECK_LIB macro

2002-06-25 16:52  ddurham

	* src/backend/initialize.cpp, docs/Makefile.am, docs/README: Added
	a feature where REZ_SHARE_DIR can be set to override the path to
	the /usr/local/share/presets.dat file.	Added a README doc
	explaining this

2002-06-25 15:33  ddurham

	* docs/INSTALL: Updated the INSTALL doc about necessary libraries
	and programs

2002-06-25 10:42  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/cfg.y: Made the cfg.y file more yacc
	compatible, but it still looks as if it will take a good bit of
	work to make cfg.y totally yacc compatible because I am doing some
	things with bison specific features.

2002-06-25 10:27  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/Makefile.am: Changed Makefile.am to call
	bison in a more yacc agreeable way

2002-06-25 09:55  ddurham

	* configure.in, docs/INSTALL, docs/NEWS: Updated files for
	0.1.2alpha

2002-06-24 23:47  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/Makefile.am: Modified slightly the
	CNestedDataFile Makefile.am's command line to $(YACC)

2002-06-24 22:27  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CFrontendHooks.cpp: Markus Rechtien caught a bug
	in ReZound caused by a side-effect of something I was doing with
	FOX's file dialog widget.  I was calling
	FXFileDialog::setDirectory() everytime I opened the dialog which
	was clearing out the filename field.  So, an open, close, then open
	by double clicking the same highlighted filename was not re-setting
	the filename field to the clicked on file (which is the only think
	I might fault FOX about)

2002-06-24 18:27  ddurham

	* src/backend/initialize.cpp: Fixed a mistake in initialize.cpp
	which looked for /usr/share/rezound isntead of /usr/share/ReZound

2002-06-24 12:20  ddurham

	* docs/NEWS: updated NEWS

2002-06-24 12:20  ddurham

2002-06-24 11:29  ddurham

	* configure.in: Fixed the big endian warning in configure.in

2002-06-24 00:44  ddurham

	* src/: backend/Edits/CPasteEdit.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CPasteChannelsDialog.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CPasteChannelsDialog.h, frontend_fox/TODO: Changed the
	bool[][] for paste channels stuff to a vector<vector<bool> > since
	gcc3 didn't like some of the casting I was doing to bool** vector
	has the pain of the elements not being there until you create them
	and you have to remember to clear them each use;
	TAutoBuffer<TAutoBuffer<bool> > would be a good solution to this,
	but I'm not going to do that just now since some version of gcc3
	out there isn't liking TAutoBuffer as it is.

2002-06-24 00:42  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Made a TODO

2002-06-24 00:16  ddurham

	* configure.in: Made ReZound's configure.in file fail if compiling
	on a big endian machine right now

2002-06-23 04:59  ddurham

	* src/: PoolFile/TODO, PoolFile/TPoolAccesser.h,
	PoolFile/TPoolFile.cpp, PoolFile/TStaticPoolAccesser.cpp,
	PoolFile/TStaticPoolAccesser.h, backend/AStatusComm.cpp,
	backend/CGraphParamValueNode.cpp, backend/Edits/CPasteEdit.cpp,
	backend/Edits/CPasteEdit.h, backend/Remaster/CUnclipAction.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CMainWindow.cpp, frontend_fox/CPasteChannelsDialog.h:
	Made changes to have ReZound compile with gcc-3.1.1 and greatfully
	it still compiles the same under gcc-2.95.2 I properly fixed most
	of the problems I think.  However, I had to work around one problem
	in src/PoolFile/TStaticPoolAccesser.h because I don't know the
	proper way to make a template parameter as a friend of the template
	And I did something that I don't think is necessary, but is just a
	bug and that is redefine 3 typedefs from TStaticPoolAccesser in the
	derived class TPoolAccesser I will have some further changes to
	make to the paste channels code to always use vector<vector<bool> >
	instead of bool** or bool[][]

2002-06-23 04:56  ddurham

	* configure.in: Added checking for -Wno-unused in configure.in ...
	I suppose tho it should be a second resort if the
	-Wno-unused-functions or the other one isn't there

2002-06-23 04:43  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/convert_images.sh: Added a check to make sure
	the $RESWRAP file existed and is executable

2002-06-23 04:27  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/fox_compat.h: fixed a booboo on a macro
	definition

2002-06-23 02:27  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/CMultiFile.cpp: Removed some redeclared default
	parameters

2002-06-22 22:08  ddurham

	* docs/INSTALL: Removed an incorrect statement in the INSTALL doc

2002-06-22 22:08  ddurham

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: Made the xxx_ABORT macro not disable the
	check if the --with flags are given

2002-06-22 21:11  ddurham

	* src/backend/TODO: Added a TODO about ClibaudiofileTranslator

2002-06-22 21:04  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/fox_compat.h: minor

2002-06-22 20:58  ddurham

	* configure.in, config/common.h,
	src/backend/ClibaudiofileSoundTranslator.cpp,
	src/frontend_fox/CMainWindow.cpp, src/frontend_fox/fox_compat.h,
	src/misc/AThread.h, src/misc/missing/stdint.h-missing: Made some
	changes to make ReZound compile on FreeBSD.  It works until the
	linking stage only with a problem of libpthread not existing.. it
	should be libc_r which I have made notes about in configure.in

2002-06-22 18:42  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Added a TODO

2002-06-22 18:41  ddurham

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, config/acconfig.h,
	config/am_include.mk, config/m4/sstream.m4, config/m4/stdint.m4,
	src/misc/CPath.h, src/misc/TAutoBuffer.h, src/misc/istring,
	src/misc/missing/sstream-missing,
	src/misc/missing/stdint.h-missing: Changed the way sstream-missing
	is used.. now it should be a transparent thing because I move the
	missing file into a src/misc/missing/generated directory Made a
	configure rule to test for stdint.h and use a file from missing if
	it's not there Added a rule to Makefile.am which removes .#* files
	from the distribution Fixed a bug with the SOURCE_DIR #define Fixed
	an incorrect path to including config.h in CPath.h and
	TAutoBuffer.h which I don't know HOW were working before now

2002-06-22 14:40  ddurham

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: minor

2002-06-22 14:38  ddurham

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: Added more output to help dignose configure
	problems

2002-06-22 13:58  ddurham

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: Didn't quite squash the bug on the last
	checkin

2002-06-22 13:55  ddurham

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: Fixed a little bug about error reporting

2002-06-21 17:10  ddurham

	* README: Added a link for submitting patches in the README

2002-06-21 15:55  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO_release: minor

2002-06-21 14:52  ddurham

	* configure.in, docs/INSTALL: Updated the version number to have 3
	fields so the last field is minor updates or fixes.. middle is
	major features added.. first is incremented when I deem it's
	sufficiently different from the previous major release.

2002-06-21 14:50  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am: Added some rules to the install
	target to have it create a softlink which is lowercase

2002-06-21 14:06  ddurham

	* config/am_include.mk: minor change to make docdir
	prefix/share/ReZound instead of rezound

	* configure.in: Fixed a small mistake in configure.in

2002-06-21 13:36  ddurham

	Made The FXWaveRuler in FXRezWaveView.cpp detect double
	left-clicking on the ruler and bring out cue-editing dialogs
	Updated the FrontendFoxFeatures.txt document about this and removed
	referenced from it about action buttons Rendered the cue's to stand
	out a little more

2002-06-21 13:13  ddurham

	* src/: backend/AStatusComm.cpp, backend/AStatusComm.h,
	frontend_fox/CStatusComm.cpp, frontend_fox/CStatusComm.h: Moved

	FXConstantParamValue where it wouldn't always readFromFile and set
	the values correctly

2002-06-21 00:32  ddurham

	* README.GL_PROBLEMS: proof-read the README.GL_PROBLEMS file

2002-06-20 21:12  ddurham

	ticky issues with Makefile.am

	commit

2002-06-20 15:32  ddurham

	* src/misc/missing/Makefile.am, Makefile.am, configure.in,
	docs/Makefile.am, share/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am,
	src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am, src/misc/Makefile.am: Found out about
	the 'dist-hook' target which makes thinks a lot easier as far as
	excluding CVS directorys and doing any cleanup necessary before
	tarring the dist up This simplied some of the Makefile.ams

2002-06-20 14:01  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/convert_images.sh: fixed a little bug in
	convert_images.sh if the .h file didn't exist

2002-06-20 11:27  ddurham

	* docs/devel/registry.dat: Didn't mean for this ever to be checked
	in

2002-06-19 18:18  ddurham

	* src/images/Makefile.am: Figured out how to use *.gif in
	images/Makefile.am instead of listing all the files explicitly

2002-06-19 17:18  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CAboutDialog.cpp, CActionMenuCommand.cpp,
	CCueListDialog.cpp, CMainWindow.cpp, CProgressDialog.cpp,
	CRecordDialog.cpp, CSoundListWindow.cpp, CSoundWindow.cpp,
	FXModalDialogBox.cpp, Makefile.am, convert_images.sh, main.cpp:
	Changed images.cpp/h to CFOXIcons.cpp/h which is now a class which
	instantiates each icons once instead of me instaniating the same
	icon many times.  Also, the script has been changed not to modify
	the h file included by many sources if it doesn't need to be
	modified, so the compile time will be much faster when just trying
	out new looks for the same icons.

2002-06-19 16:13  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CActionParamDialog.cpp, CActionParamDialog.h,
	CChannelSelectDialog.cpp, CCrossfadeEdgesDialog.cpp,

	CRecordDialog.cpp, CSoundListWindow.cpp, EditActionDialogs.cpp,
	EffectActionDialogs.cpp, FXConstantParamValue.cpp,
	FXModalDialogBox.cpp, FXModalDialogBox.h, FilterActionDialogs.cpp,
	RemasterActionDialogs.cpp, TODO: Cleaned up the frontend code a bit
	so that it doesn't require specifying a default width/height for
	all the dialogs.  Now I use getDefaultWidth() and
	getDefaultHeight() for knowing how big the dialog "wants" to be.  I
	removed the width and height parameters from CActionParamDialog's
	constructor.  Updated the TODO about this

2002-06-19 16:09  ddurham

	* src/backend/ASoundFileManager.cpp: Fixed an accidently change of
	'.' to CNestedDataFile::delimChar

2002-06-19 14:49  ddurham

	* src/: backend/ASoundFileManager.cpp,
	frontend_fox/CActionParamDialog.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXComboTextParamValue.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXConstantParamValue.cpp,
	frontend_fox/FXGraphParamValue.cpp,

	misc/CNestedDataFile/CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	misc/CNestedDataFile/CNestedDataFile.h, misc/CNestedDataFile/cfg.l,
	misc/CNestedDataFile/cfg.y: created CNestedDataFile::delimChar
	which determins which character will be the scope delimiter in a
	key instead of it being fixed to '.' I did this so presets' names
	could contain '.' and I made the delimited '|' for now.  I changed
	all the code that used CNestedDataFile not to have any hardcoded
	'.'s but now it uses CNestedDataFile::delimChar

2002-06-19 12:07  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp, cfg.l: Updated
	CNestedDataFile to be able to really have most any character
	between 32 and 126 in the name of a key by using '\' infront of it

2002-06-19 00:04  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp, cfg.l: Changed
	CNestedDataFile to allow identifiers to be able to start with a
	number.  This may cause some ambiguities with arithmetic
	expressions, but I'm not using them

2002-06-19 00:01  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CMainWindow.cpp,
	src/frontend_fox/EffectActionDialogs.cpp,
	src/frontend_fox/EffectActionDialogs.h, share/presets.dat,
	src/backend/Effects/CChangeAmplitudeEffect.cpp,
	src/backend/Effects/CChangeAmplitudeEffect.h: Split "Change
	Amplitude" into "Change Volume" and "Gain" where gain has the
	advanced mode curve.  Both still just use a single backend

	COSSSoundPlayer.h, CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp, initialize.cpp: Made it
	a non-fatal error if there is an error initializing the sound
	player.  So the sound player is allocated but stays uninitialized

	would be necessary to check is in CSoundPlayerChannel that the
	player is initialized in the play() method.  All other methods are
	contingent on it being in a playing state (playing==true) or that
	it doesn't matter.

	* src/backend/ASoundFileManager.cpp: minor

2002-06-10 12:18  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/CSoundFileManager.cpp: Moved the updating of the
	filename into CSoundWindow::updateFromEdit

2002-06-09 23:45  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CActionMenuCommand.cpp, CActionMenuCommand.h:
	Fixed a bug in CActionMenuCommand where it wouldn't detect right
	click because the SEL_COMMAND handler was handling the action
	always

2002-06-09 02:01  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/main.cpp: Forgot to remove some stuff in
	main.cpp when removing CEditToolBar.*

	CEditToolbar.cpp, CEditToolbar.h, CMainWindow.cpp, CMainWindow.h,

	for now.  They're in the ATTIC directory if needed again

2002-06-07 18:42  ddurham

	* src/VerifySourceFiles.sh: Made VerifySourceFiles.sh check for
	fox_compat.h as the second include in all the frontend code.  Also
	restructored this script's code to be more readily reused

2002-06-07 18:41  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CAboutDialog.cpp, CAboutDialog.h,

	Makefile.am, RemasterActionDialogs.h, drawPortion.h, fox_compat.h,
	main.cpp, rememberShow.cpp, rememberShow.h, settings.h: Added
	fox_compat.h which makes the frontend code compile with FOX with
	the newer namespaced (and some functions renamed) version as well
	as the old (pre 1.1.8) version and automatically detects which I
	then had to include fox_compat.h just after every include of
	common.h in all the frontend code The new verison of FOX fixed the
	walking window problem, so I can now pretty much reliably save and
	restore window positions between runs of ReZound Fixed
	CActionMenuCommand to respond to the automatic accelerator keys
	Made CActionMenuCommand get the menu item's caption based on the
	actionFactory's getName() method.  So now I don't have to repeat
	that action name in the frontend code that creates all the menu
	items.	Other minor changes

2002-06-07 18:36  ddurham

	* src/backend/: Edits/CRotateEdit.cpp, Edits/CSelectionEdit.cpp,
	Edits/CSelectionEdit.h, Effects/CDelayEffect.cpp,

	have better action names

2002-06-06 01:55  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CEditToolbar.cpp, CMainWindow.cpp,
	CMainWindow.h, CSoundWindow.cpp, main.cpp: Made changes to move
	toward removing CEditToolbar Moved all the edit actions under an
	Edit pull-down menu Coded for there to be a button for each edit
	action on the main window, but didn't like the way it looked...
	I'll remove that code once I'm sure that I don't need it.  Found
	out that fox automatically supports hot keys pretty well in the
	menu items.  I'm having a little trouble with certain key
	combinations, but hope to fix that tomorrow.  Changed the default
	location and size of CSoundWindow when it starts.  I might be able
	to move CSoundListWindow's content onto the main window now that
	there is room, but I'm not going to worry about that right now

2002-06-06 00:17  ddurham

	src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am, src/images/advanced_action.gif,
	src/images/images.cpp, src/images/images.h,
	src/images/normal_action.gif: Added CActionMenuCommand and moved
	all the effects and file action buttons to pulldown menu items. 
	CActionMenuCommand can also detect whether the left or right mouse
	button was used to click on the menu item.  This way I won't have
	to create icons for every action.  And I can give a more useful
	text description of the action in the menu item.  Added two icons
	that go next to every action (non-file) on the pull down menu. 
	Which of the 2 icons indicates whether the action has advanced mode

	* src/frontend_fox/: CActionButton.cpp, CActionButton.h, main.cpp:
	Altered the way CActionButton is implemented to a likely a more
	reliable implementation.  Now, it intercepts the mouse button

	returns 1 or 0 it my implemented handle does or doesn't do the
	action.

	widgets.  Possible you can specify the parent of the widget itself.

	AAction::getResultingCrossfadePoints which asks the action in
	advance of actually doing it.  Almost always, it is not necessary
	to override the default functionality, but actions like paste do
	need to.

	do.  ASoundClipboard is a base class which edits use, and there are
	will be derivations for various sources.  So far, I only have
	CNativeSoundClipboard.	I have yet to create a frontend selection
	for choosing which clipboard to use.  Got rid of the cheap-o
	clipboard stuff that previously existed in AAction.  Fixed the
	problem of the collapsing gaps when you copied from not all the
	channels.  Added some TODO items Fixed a little big in
	AAction::crossfadeEdgesInner where it needed to skip some of the
	saved data when crossfading on the stop end and the crossfade was
	going to be cut short.

	src/frontend_fox/main.cpp: Added a feature that I've been wanting
	to add but have been just putting it off.  Now, after an action to
	which it is applicable, a short crossfade is performed at the start
	and stop positions to give a smooth transition from data outside
	the selection to data inside the selection.  I created a frontend
	interface which allows the user to easily un-check a checkbox to
	disable this functionality if he doesn't want a crossfade.  And,
	next to that checkbox is a button which pops up a dialog so the
	user can select the amount of time that each of the two crossfades
	take.  The principle I went with was in effect, at a pointer
	(either the start of the stop) you pull what's beyond the point to
	overlap at a place before this point and crossfade the two
	overlapping areas.  The amount that the data is pulled to overlap
	is the time that the user selected.  Then this is repeated for the
	start and stop position (unless they are the same point) There
	still may be some tweaking to do, but for the most part it is
	complete.  This behavior doesn't lend itself to actions like, cue
	edits, selection changes, and copy, so AActionFactory has a
	parameter to its constructor which can be passed false to indicate
	that this crossfade is not to be done.

	src/frontend_fox/main.cpp: Did a huge code reorganization which in
	it self wasn't so large except that it require change a large
	portion of all the source files Renamed ASound to CSound since now
	you don't derive from it to create the multiple format
	implementations.  Now you derived from ASoundTranslator for each
	format to support.  The derivation converts to and from the
	internal format.  Moved most of the definitions in the top of
	ASound.h/CSound.h into a file, CSound_defs.h so that you don't have
	to include all of CSound when you only need sample_pos_t Removed
	some of the commented code prior to using the STL Removed
	CSoundManager and CSoundManagerClient.	It was an extra level of
	management/book-keeping that wasn't necessary.	Now
	ASoundFileManager does it all.	Changed ASoundFileManger to use the
	ASoundTranslator objects for loading/saving.  Added
	ASoundFileManager::getTranslated which given a file name attempts
	to find the translator that should support that format.        
	Later, I may have an enum parameter to this method which explicitly
	says which format is desired, reguardless of the filename's
	extension or the file's data	Also in the furture, I could have
	that method iterate through a list of registered translator objects
	and which could be setup once at run-time in the beginning to be
	used from then on which would be conducive to the idea of plugins. 
	Now, with the new translator idea, you can convert between formats
	with ease, by just using save-as.  Prior, all you could do was
	copy/paste to convert between file formats.  Made
	ASoundFileManager::save not have deconstructed everything already
	if an error occurs while saving Better provisions made for
	supporting a raw file format, yet not complete yet.  Now, the
	filename of an opened sound is an attribute of CLoadedSound instead
	of the ASound object... This wasn't completly necessary, but it
	gives more flexability if we wanted to use truely random filenames
	for the working file of the CSound object.  Updated the TODO lists
	concerning these tasks

	frontend_fox/TODO, frontend_fox/initialize.cpp,
	frontend_fox/initialize.h, frontend_fox/main.cpp,
	frontend_fox/settings.cpp, frontend_fox/settings.h: Mainly moved
	code around into a better organization...  Split
	frontend_fox/settings.* into a file in the frontend directory and
	one in the backend directory for settings that would apply to any
	frontend implementation.  Hopefully without trouble, I had to move
	some of the libraries orderings in the Makefiles because I was
	getting linker errors after moving some of the code to the backend
	Moved most of the code that was in frontend_fox/initialize.cpp into
	backend/initialize.cpp	      Most of the code in there belonged in
	the backend that would have just been duplicated in a different
	frontend implementation.	  I just hope that my one stage,
	toss between the frontend and backend for initialization is
	adequate in the furture.     I could see something where a little
	needs to be done in the frontend, then a little in the backend,
	then some more in the front, then a little more in the back, etc,
	where this current configuration wouldn't be sufficient.  Got rid
	of frontend_fox/initialize.* and put what little was left into
	main.cpp.  main.cpp really is the frontend initialization anyway.  
	    Move all the window creations to a function in main.cpp  Got
	rid of gMainWindow so it's not a global any more.  Moved most of
	the reopen code that deals with the registry file into the backend
	(ASoundFileManager) instead of having to duplicate that also in an
	alternative frontend.  Renamed ASoundFileManager::redrawActive to
	updateAfterEdit because redraw active was doing more than just a
	redraw, but was updating status info too.  Removed some unnecessary
	commented code from CMainWindow Changed some reference parameters
	to ASoundFileManager to pointers because it made more sense.  There
	may be other reference data-members in the backend code that I will
	do this to as well.  Fixed a little glitch in COSSSoundPlayer's
	data-member initialization ordering Updated the TODO lists
	concerning these issues

	* src/PoolFile/: CMultiFile.cpp, CMultiFile.h: Tweaked CMultiFile
	not to call ftruncate so much.	It was calling it for every write

	ftruncate is an expensive system call.	Well, writing past the end

	* src/: backend/Makefile.am, backend/Edits/Makefile.am,
	backend/Effects/Makefile.am, backend/Remaster/Makefile.am,
	frontend_fox/Makefile.am: Removed dependencies which I don't think
	are needed.

2002-03-31 18:55  lergnom

	* docs/devel/TODO_autoconf, src/PoolFile/Makefile.am: Removed
	Dependecies Which I don't think we need

	alternate directory builds. make distcheck works again

2002-03-31 02:18  ddurham

	something about CActionParamDialog saving the splitter position

2002-03-31 01:11  ddurham

	* src/backend/: CGraphParamValueNode.cpp,
	Effects/CChangeAmplitudeEffect.cpp, Effects/CChangeRateEffect.cpp:

	parameter

2002-03-31 01:10  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	CNestedDataFile.h: Made CNestedDataFile check a key that is be
	created for invalid characters upon the next parse of the file

2002-03-30 03:05  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/initialize.cpp: Changed initialize.cpp to use
	DATA_DIR for /usr/share instead of the PREFIX_DIR/share

2002-03-30 03:02  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CActionParamDialog.cpp, CActionParamDialog.h,
	EffectActionDialogs.cpp, FXConstantParamValue.cpp: The width value
	is now ignored for CActionParamDialog the width is determined.	I
	would like to also eliminate the height parameter as well
	eventually.  Then I would remove those 2 parameters.  Made
	CActionParamDialog save the splitter's position so that if the user
	concentrates more on presets then he can move the splitter to show
	mostly presets and it will stay that way between runs

2002-03-30 01:22  lergnom

	* bootstrap, configure.in: added #define DATA_DIR to be set during
	configure. This is preferable to usign prefix/share

2002-03-30 01:14  ddurham

	combining CConstantParamActionDialog and CGraphParamActionDialog
	into CActionParamDialog which can have constant and graph
	parameters on it I changed all the existing dialogs to use
	CActionParamDialog.  I changed FXGraphParamValue and
	FXConstantParamValue to be able to read and write to
	CNestedDataFile so that presets are abstracted more The only thing
	lacking is a way to change the layout of the parameter widgets to
	something other than horizontally laid-out

2002-03-29 20:50  lergnom

	* bootstrap: bootstrap script autogenerated using bootstrapper
	(same usage and process as hand written one)

2002-03-29 17:58  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	CNestedDataFile.h: Enhanced CNestedDataFile with some more features
	  - save on each edit	  - parse not just on construction	  -
	simple method to save back to the file it wrote (careful, all
	expressions and comments are stripped)	- ability to construct from
	no file at all

2002-03-28 22:26  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: CSoundListWindow.cpp, CSoundListWindow.h,
	main.cpp: Made the CSoundListWindow not show until there is more
	than one sound loaded and made it hide when all but one is closed

2002-03-28 20:38  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Added some TODOs for pasting

2002-03-28 20:38  ddurham

2002-03-28 20:37  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/FXConstantParamValue.cpp: Fixed a little bug

	* src/frontend_fox/: CConstantParamActionDialog.cpp,
	CConstantParamActionDialog.h, FXConstantParamValue.cpp,
	FXConstantParamValue.h: Added my first go at letting users save/use
	presets.  There are two sections: one native list of presets that
	is stored in share/rezound/presets.dat and one that is stored in
	the users home directory The native list cannot be modified by the
	user and the user's custom list can.  Perhaps if you're running in
	development mode I should add buttons for adding and removing on
	the native list too Added some methods in FXConstantParamValue to
	accomplish this.  Currently, the only saved values are the constant
	param values.  I plan to also store any other type of widgets
	supported in CConstantParamActionDialog I think what I need to do
	is generalize CConstantParamActionDialog into something which has
	methods for adding constant parameter sliders and graphs and
	whatever else I come up with later.  This way I would have one
	class that can be used to easily generate dialogs for actions.

	frontend_fox/CSoundFileManager.cpp: Changed ClibaudiofileSound to
	use libaudiofile's functions for reading and writing cues.	
	The current cvs version of libaudiofile does not actually have cues
	(markers) implemented fully.  But I patched libaudiofile to support
	loading and saving cues for the wave format and submitted the patch
	to them.  Changed ClibaudiofileSound to go ahead and handle
	libaudiofile's other supported formats.  libaudiofile seems to be
	further along about loading cues and other miscellaneous data than
	the other audio file libs I'm considering

	config.h to be set by configure. This way you can hard code the
	paths to share directories at compile time.

2002-03-27 18:13  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	CNestedDataFile.h: Added methods to CNestedDataFile to modify and

	creating of CVariedRepeatEffect Also, added ALFO::getValue which
	lets to get a value of that LFO at a given time

2002-03-27 10:09  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/cfg.l: Fixed a little bug in
	CNestedDataFile.  A subsequent parse with errors was wrongly also
	reporting errors because the error count was not being reset to 0.

2002-03-27 08:35  lergnom

	* docs/INSTALL: Added some version info >1.9.1 for commonc++ to
	INSTALL. Debian 3.0 commonc++ isn't adequate for proper

	frontend_fox/CMainWindow.cpp, frontend_fox/EffectActionDialogs.cpp,
	frontend_fox/EffectActionDialogs.h: Added CVariedRepeatEffect -- A
	simple effect which could be enhanced in man ways.  It simply takes
	the selection and repeats more or less of it depending on an LFO

2002-03-25 20:37  lergnom

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	CNestedDataFile.h, cfg.l, test_CNestedDataFile.cpp: Added an

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/CNestedDataFile.cpp: Fixed some warnings
	in CNestedDataFile.cpp

2002-03-19 16:38  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO, src/backend/CSoundPlayerChannel.cpp,
	src/backend/CSoundPlayerChannel.h, src/backend/TODO,
	src/frontend_fox/TODO: Enhanged CSoundPlayerChannel to interpolate
	the sample data when mixing onto the buffer since the sample rate
	can come back a non-standard value from initializing a sound card. 
	When I tried using ReZound on David van Balen's debian machine with
	a cheap-o sound card it wouldn't give me 22050 like I asked but
	came back with 22099 which caused CSoundPlayerChannel's ouput to be
	aliased with normal audio files of 44100 and 22050.  Updated the
	TODO lists about this and distributed a few more items from
	docs/devel/TODO to the specific frontend and backend TODOs

2002-03-19 15:53  lergnom

	* configure.in, docs/devel/TODO_autoconf: touch up-s

	Fixed some compatibility issues with fox0.99

2002-03-18 12:50  ddurham

	* src/backend/COSSSoundPlayer.cpp: - In COSSSoundPlayer the ioctl
	for setting the sample rate can return a different value than was
	used.  - I used to throw an exception when this happened, but when
	testing it on David van Balen's machine I found that it's better to
	just print a warning and don't worry about it.	- This does mean,
	however, that I need to do interpolation in the CSoundPlayerChannel
	rather than a simple sample rate conversion.  I should implement
	this to detect if the sample rates are integer multiples of each
	other and still do the simple way if so.

2002-03-18 09:52  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: Makefile, a, t.cpp,
	test_CNestedDataFile.cpp: Created a real Makefile which should
	compile the test for CNestedDataFile removed 'a' and 't.cpp'

2002-03-18 09:40  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/Makefile: CScope.h was supposed to be
	CNestedDataFile.h;  I renamed it just before I checked it in

2002-03-17 23:45  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO: Added something to a TODO item

2002-03-17 23:41  ddurham

	* src/backend/CrezSound.cpp: Made CrezSound now only require a
	shared lock when saving rather than an exclusive lock which caused
	the sound to pause if it was playing at the same time it was saving

2002-03-17 23:41  ddurham

	* src/PoolFile/: CMultiFile.cpp, CMultiFile.h, TPoolFile.cpp,
	TPoolFile.h: Fixed a major bug/design-flaw in PoolFile where I was
	potentially confusing seek positions between threads since the seek
	position was maintained only once in the CMultiFile object in a
	PoolFile

2002-03-17 00:14  ddurham

	* src/backend/CrezSound.cpp: Fixed a save bug in CrezSound.cpp and
	I discovered a more major problem in CPoolFile, but I have a fix
	and will make it soon

2002-03-16 23:38  ddurham

2002-03-15 00:19  lergnom

	* configure.in, config/m4/cxx-lib.m4: added AC_DISABLE_SHARED,
	which stops libtool from building objects for shared libraries,
	this cuts the amount of files we compile in half.
	
	All this talk between Davy and I about libtool has done some good.

2002-03-14 15:15  lergnom

	* config/am_include.mk, config/m4/cxx-lib.m4, docs/INSTALL,
	src/PoolFile/Makefile.am: Trying to get the --with-LIB.. flags to
	work well. Now if you use a --with-LIB-include or --with-LIB-path
	it overrides that test. This is all an effort to get this to work
	on the compile farm.

2002-03-14 13:08  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO, src/backend/TODO, src/frontend_fox/TODO:
	Reorganized and updated the overall TODO and move some of the items
	into the backend TODO and frontend TODO

2002-03-14 12:54  ddurham

	* src/: backend/TODO, frontend_fox/TODO: Reorganized and updated
	the frontend and backend TODO lists

2002-03-14 12:41  ddurham

2002-03-14 08:38  lergnom

	* config/m4/cxx-lib.m4, docs/devel/TODO_autoconf,
	src/frontend_fox/Makefile.am: Turned frontend_fox directory to
	build libfrontend.la and main.o so the linking will be more
	consistent (and the Makefile's)

2002-03-14 02:43  ddurham

	* src/misc/CNestedDataFile/: CNestedDataFile.cpp,
	CNestedDataFile.h, a, cfg.l, cfg.y, t.cpp: I updated
	CNestedDataFile to be more functional.	I pretty much rewrote the
	whole way it internally stores and retrieves the data.	It's now
	more memory efficient, but not (maybe) less CPU efficient. 
	Although I could fix that if necesssary, but for now it will only
	be used for rather small data files.  It can now write the data
	back out to a file.  Except, that it has the huge (but hard to
	overcome) limitation of writing any arithmetic expressions back out
	as the calculated value.  And it strips the output file of any
	comments or added whitespace from the input file.  For now I won't
	even be using the arithmetic expressions feature anyway.

2002-03-13 23:44  ddurham

	* docs/devel/TODO_autoconf: Added notes to my previous entry in
	TODO_autoconf

2002-03-13 23:37  ddurham

	config/m4/cxx-lib.m4, config/m4/cxx.m4, docs/INSTALL,
	docs/devel/TODO_autoconf, docs/devel/TODO_release: Cleaned some
	stuff up with bootstrap, so it won't complain when it runs.
	
	Hopefully fixed the -Wno.. flags so they shoud be added to CXXFLAGS
	at compilation time (if valid)
	
	Added option to specify library path (-L) for FOX audiofile, and
	ccgnu. These flags should only be necessary if libraries are in an
	unusual place.

	* src/frontend_fox/: FXGraphParamValue.cpp, FXGraphParamValue.h,
	FXPackerCanvas.cpp, FXPackerCanvas.h, FXRezWaveView.cpp,
	Makefile.am: Completely reworked the FXGraphParamValue widget.	I
	no longer use FXPackerCanvas to draw the background and put FXFrame
	widgets on top.  Now I manage drawing, click-detection, and
	dragging of the nodes on my own.  I think this will be better
	overall in the long-run.  It did even shrink the code a good bit. 
	Smoothed out the way nodes configure themselves when moving an
	existing node thru other existing nodes.  Also updated the
	Makefile.am not to deal with FXPackerCanvas any longer.

2002-03-12 16:50  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/FXGraphParamValue.cpp: 
	- Solved the goofy movement of nodes in the FXGraphParamValue
	widget.  - But I have resolved that it will be less trouble in the
	long run just to manage drawing the nodes myself and detecting when
	they get clicked on and dragged and such.  - Fewer or no problems
	should arise when I port to windows

2002-03-12 01:15  ddurham

	* src/frontend_fox/: FXGraphParamValue.cpp, FXGraphParamValue.h: 
	Added backbuffer drawing to the FXGraphParamValue widget, and also
	am working toward a fix on the goofy node movement behavior
